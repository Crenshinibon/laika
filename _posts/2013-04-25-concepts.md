`laika` is a combination of technologies including `phantomjs`, `mocha`, `meteor` itself and  some tricks. In this section you'll be learning how laika works internally. It will help you to write better tests and understand why laika is bit slower than other testing frameworks.

## Testing with the actual app
`laika` is not anything about mocking or stubbing. Your tests will be tested against your actuall meteor app and using real browsers (`phantomjs` in this case)

## Each test will run on it's own app and a separate database
Best thing about laika is, each test will run against separate process or your app and with a clean db. This is really good since your tests are `isolated` from another. It's kind a slower, but we've reduced the slowness with following techniques.

* fast mongod process with these options - `mongod --smallfiles --noprealloc --nojournal`
* pooling apps so you don't need to wait app to get loaded 
* Running `mongod` on a ramdisk - [see this guide](using-ram-disk.html)

There are some other ways to increase the speed, but not yet tested

* Use parallel testing (`mocha` does not support this, and writing a test suite from the ground is not cool)

## Server and your test communicate via a TCP connection

* At the beginning of the test, `laika` will inject piece of [code block](http://goo.gl/Cx5E0)(runs on server) into your meteor app
* When your app starts it will start a TCP connection and your test now can communicate with the server
* Test sends codes over the TCP connection and injected code will `eval()` it
* Result of the `eval()` will be send via the TCP connection too (using `emit()` which you've seen on the getting started guide)

## Client code is too evaluated on a real browser

* We use [`phantomjs`](http://phantomjs.org/) for this, it is a headless webkit browser
* Code will be evaluated on the client with [`evaluate()`](http://goo.gl/Efa8q) of phantomjs and injecting small [piece of code](http://goo.gl/7mZXW) into your meteor app

## All the injected code will be removed

* Injected code can be used to exploit your app in production
* But don't worry we'll remove it after the test
* Of course you can check it with  `git diff` :) 

## Using `mocha`

* What `laika` focus on how you can write tests on both client and the server at once.
* We don't need to build another test suite 
* So we use [`mocha`](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) internally
