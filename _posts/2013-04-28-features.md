## It's real

`laika` runs tests against your real running app. So It works everytime.

## Isolated testing

each test runs on against a separate instance of your `meteor` app and a clean `mongodb` database.

## Works with both meteor and meteorite

You can use `meteor` or [`meteorite`](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite) as your development workflow. laika can work with both without any additional work for you.

## evaluate codes on both server and client at once

You can evaluate codes at both the server and client on a single test. It helps to test unique meteor features like
 * permission
 * subscriptions
 * method calls

#### Example

    test('using both client and the server', function(done, server, client) {
      server.eval(function() {
        Posts.find().observe({
          added: addedNewPost
        });

        function addedNewPost(post) {
          emit('post', post);
        }
      }).once('post', function(post) {
        assert.equal(post.title, 'hello title');
        done();
      });

      client.eval(function() {
        Posts.insert({title: 'hello title'});
      });
    });

## Tests with multiple clients

Meteor is all about realtime. So we need to test with multiple client. `laika` simply allows you to test with `unlimited`(theoretically) no of clients. See usage below.

    test('using both client and the server', function(done, server, c1, c2, c3, c4) {
      
    });

`laika` will inspect no of arguments you specified and inject `client` connector for each.

See [example](http://goo.gl/dMwQf) using multiple clients

## EventEmitter like communication pattern between your test an evaluate code

Running a piece of code on the server or client and get the result is not ideal. It should be event based. So we've a event emitter like api pattern to communicate with the server and client.

#### Example

    server.eval(function() {
      emit('return', 10);
      Meteor.setTimeout(function() {
        emit('after-2-secs');
      }, 2000);
    });

    server.once('return', function(value) {
      assert.equal(value, 10);
    });

    server.once('after-2-secs', function() {
      
    });

## Pass runtime values to evaluated code 

We can pass runtime values to evaluated code via arguments.

#### Example

    server.eval(function(a, b) {
      emit('sum', a + b);
    }, 10, 20);

    server.once('sum', function(value) {
      assert.equal(value, 30);
    });
